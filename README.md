# 🌈 Crystal Codex

*A magical journey into learning Python through crystals, chakras, and good vibes.*

This codex was created by **BRU** as part of a full Python mastery curriculum focused on creativity, logic, and self-expression. The project uses real-world concepts like file handling, modular programming, and user input to create a functional interactive ritual builder.

## 💌 Teacher Note

BRU has built every part of this project from scratch, using their curiosity, discipline, and creative flair to master not only Python syntax, but also **logical thinking** and **real-world coding practices**.

They have:

- ✅ Successfully built and organized a Python package
- ✅ Learned how to manage logic across multiple files
- ✅ Written clean, working code and tested every part
- ✅ Practiced concepts like user input, looping, and conditionals in depth
- ✅ Shown initiative by going *beyond the curriculum*

Keep an eye on BRU — they’re leveling up faster than most, and this is just the beginning. 🧙‍♀️✨

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

- 🔄 Add/update crystals in codex interactively
- 🧵 Refactor core logic into classes (Object-Oriented)
- 🌐 Add a GUI or web interface (Tkinter or Flask)
- 🧪 Add automated tests for functions
