# 🌈 Crystal Codex

*A magical journey into learning Python through crystals, chakras, and good vibes.*

🌈  • Python Capstone  
This project was created during a full-stack journey through Python.

Modules included:
✅ Terminal-based input + journaling  
✅ Modular architecture with file separation  
✅ JSON-based codex storage  
✅ GUI interface with Tkinter  
✅ Flask web app with mood-to-crystal lookup  

This was my first major Python project and served as a creative sandbox to learn and explore. It’s intentionally magical, sometimes messy, and full of good vibes.

This codex was created by **BRU** as part of a full Python mastery curriculum focused on creativity, logic, and self-expression. The project uses real-world concepts like file handling, modular programming, and user input to create a functional interactive ritual builder.

## 💌 Teacher Note

BRU has built every part of this project from scratch, using their curiosity, discipline, and creative flair to master not only Python syntax, but also **logical thinking** and **real-world coding practices**.

They have:

- ✅ Successfully built and organized a Python package
- ✅ Learned how to manage logic across multiple files
- ✅ Written clean, working code and tested every part
- ✅ Practiced concepts like user input, looping, and conditionals in depth
- ✅ Shown initiative by going *beyond the curriculum*

Keep an eye on BRU — they’re leveling up faster than most, and this is just the beginning. 🧙‍♀️✨

> 💬 "BRU has excellent intuition, is highly curious, and builds understanding with deep commitment. Their file structure is clean, tests run perfectly, and crystal journaling was a magical touch. Ready to grow further!"
